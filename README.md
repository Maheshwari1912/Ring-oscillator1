**Introduction to Ring Oscillator**

A ring oscillator is a simple oscillator circuit consisting of an odd number of inverters connected in a loop. It is a self-sustaining oscillator that generates a clock-like periodic signal without requiring an external clock.

**How a Ring Oscillator Works**

The output of the last inverter is fed back to the input of the first inverter.

Due to propagation delay in the inverters, the signal continuously toggles between 0 and 1, creating an oscillating waveform.

**The frequency of oscillation depends on:**

Number of inverters (More inverters = Lower frequency)

Gate delay of each inverter

Power supply voltage

Temperature variations

**Ring Oscillator Frequency Calculation
The oscillation period is given by:**

𝑇=2×𝑁×𝑡𝑑

where:

N = Number of inverters

td = Propagation delay of a single inverter

Thus, the frequency is:

𝑓=1/𝑇=1/(2×𝑁×𝑡𝑑)

**Advantages of Ring Oscillator**

 Simple Design (No external clock required)
 
 Low Power Consumption
 
 Useful for Built-In Self-Test (BIST) in ICs
 
 Used for On-Chip Clock Generation

**Disadvantages of Ring Oscillator**

 Unstable Frequency (Varies with temperature & voltage)

 Not Highly Precise (Less accurate than crystal oscillators)

 Lower Frequency Stability (Affected by manufacturing variations)

**Applications of Ring Oscillators**

Frequency Synthesis in PLL (Phase-Locked Loops)

On-Chip Clock Generation for Digital Circuits

Process Variation Analysis in Semiconductor Chips

True Random Number Generators (TRNGs)
